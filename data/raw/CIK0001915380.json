Includes stock with put option held by ESOP and stock redeemable by holder only in the event of a change in control of the issuer.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2022-09-30","val":10.15,"accn":"0001193125-22-284555","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-11-14","frame":"CY2022Q3I"}]}},"UnrecognizedTaxBenefits":{"label":"Unrecognized Tax Benefits","description":"Amount of unrecognized tax benefits.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2022-09-30","val":0,"accn":"0001193125-22-284555","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-11-14","frame":"CY2022Q3I"}]}},"UnrecognizedTaxBenefitsIncomeTaxPenaltiesAndInterestAccrued":{"label":"Unrecognized Tax Benefits, Income Tax Penalties and Interest Accrued","description":"Amount accrued for interest on an underpayment of income taxes and penalties related to a tax position claimed or expected to be claimed in the tax return.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2022-09-30","val":0,"accn":"0001193125-22-284555","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-11-14","frame":"CY2022Q3I"}]}},"WeightedAverageNumberOfDilutedSharesOutstanding":{"label":"Weighted Average Number of Shares Outstanding, Diluted","description":"The average number of shares or units issued and outstanding that are used in calculating diluted EPS or earnings per unit (EPU), determined based on the timing of issuance of shares or units in the period.","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2022-02-15","end":"2022-09-30","val":1500000,"accn":"0001193125-22-284555","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-11-14"},{"start":"2022-07-01","end":"2022-09-30","val":1500000,"accn":"0001193125-22-284555","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-11-14","frame":"CY2022Q3"}]}},"WeightedAverageNumberOfSharesCommonStockSubjectToRepurchaseOrCancellation":{"label":"Weighted Average Number of Shares, Common Stock Subject to Repurchase or Cancellation","description":"Number of shares of common stock subject to repurchase or cancellation determined by relating the portion of time within a reporting period that these shares have been outstanding to the total time in that period.
