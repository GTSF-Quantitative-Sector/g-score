Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":1.35,"accn":"0001575872-22-001095","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-11-14","frame":"CY2021"},{"start":"2022-01-01","end":"2022-09-30","val":1.14,"accn":"0001575872-22-001095","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-11-14"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-12-31","val":0.001,"accn":"0001575872-22-001095","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-11-14","frame":"CY2021"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRateMaximum":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate, Maximum","description":"The maximum risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2022-01-01","end":"2022-09-30","val":0.0285,"accn":"0001575872-22-001095","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-11-14"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRateMinimum":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate, Minimum","description":"The minimum risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2022-01-01","end":"2022-09-30","val":0.02,"accn":"0001575872-22-001095","fy":2022,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2022-11-14"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
